### About myself
I finished my bachelor's degree at ITMO university and now I'm looking forward to become a front-end developer. I have already tried to learn programing several times but failed because of my lack of patience and making the mistake of setting very high expectations of myself. Now I just enjoy coding and love to solve different code challenges on codewars and create websites from challenges on frontendmentor. To me, the field of front-end is vast and I want to become a great programmer who is able to create complex apps. In the future after learning React and Typescript I want to learn a staticly typed language and maybe try out ML. I have become really curious about programming and I want to learn as much as possible from any resource I can get my hands on
